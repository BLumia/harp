# Autokalimba
A chordal musical instrument for your thumbs! [Play it here on a phone.](http://foldr.moe/harp/)

✨ Demos: ✨ https://twitter.com/search?q=%23autokalimba&f=video (I will be very happy if you tweet your own performances).

## Features
* Press a bass note key on the left to play it.
* Press a chord key on the right to play a chord on the last bass note you played!
* The **middle slider** controls the pitch range of bass notes.
* Wiggle your thumb up and down on the chord key to add **vibrato**.
* Press **Settings** in the top-left to tweak instrument and strum behavior.
* With **split keys** enabled, press the bottom part on a bass key to play a 5 in the bass.
* There are some hacky QWERTY controls (enable _Horizontal chords_ under settings and hit some keys to find the layout).

## Un-features
* Triads
* …
* Okay, I might add an “uncomplicated chords mode” if people really want it, but their omission is very deliberate.
