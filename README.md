A chordal musical instrument for your thumbs! [Play it here on a phone.](http://foldr.moe/harp/)

Or listen here: ✨ https://twitter.com/search?q=%23autokalimba&f=video ✨

(I will be very happy if you tweet your own performances and tag them `#autokalimba`!!)

## Features
* Press a bass note key on the left to play it.
* Press a chord key on the right to play a chord on the last bass note you played!
* The **middle slider** controls the pitch range of bass notes.
* Wiggle your thumb up and down on the chord key to add **vibrato**.
* Press **Settings** in the top-left to tweak instrument and strum behavior.
* With **split keys** enabled, press the bottom part on a bass key to play a 5 in the bass.
* There are some hacky QWERTY controls (enable _Horizontal chords_ under settings and hit some keys to find the layout).

## Un-features
* Triads
* …
* Okay, I might add an “uncomplicated chords mode” if people really want it, but their omission is deliberate.

## FAQ

### Why is the repository called `harp`?
When I made the repository, I only knew I was making something like a digital [autoharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoharp). The name "autokalimba" was suggested by [@profanegeometry on Twitter](https://twitter.com/profanegeometry/status/1456963454573572102), and it stuck, but `foldr.moe/harp` is easier to type into a URL bar, so I didn't want to change the repository name.

### What is 7s, 13s, ø, o?
7sus4, 13sus4, m7♭5, dim7

### Your vibrato code causes slight pitch drift when I don't exactly center my thumb on the chord button!!
Yeah! Isn't it cute??
